In FlappyBird, you take control of a small bird on a mission to dodge as many pillars as possible. The game's simplicity is matched only by its difficultyâ€”press space to make the bird fly higher 
and avoid crashing into the pillars. Your score increases with each pillar you successfully pass, and the goal is to achieve the highest score possible before inevitably crashing.

How to Play
Press Space in the screen to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
Dodge the incoming pillars by navigating through the gaps.
Score points for each pillar you pass.
Restart the game upon crashing and try to beat your high score!

Features

High Score Tracking: Keep track of your best scores and try to surpass them.
